      id: 1,
      title: "The Super Hot Giant",
      description: "This planet is HUGE like Jupiter and super close to its star! It's so hot, metal would melt there!",
      difficulty: "Easy",
      icon: "üî•",
      clues: {
        size: "Very Big (like Jupiter)",
        temperature: "Super Hot! (over 1000¬∞C)",
        orbitTime: "Very Fast (only 3 days)",
        distance: "Super close to its star"
      },
      answer: "CONFIRMED",
      funFact: "This is called a 'Hot Jupiter'! Scientists think it formed far away and then moved closer to its star. Imagine if Jupiter was as close to the Sun as Mercury! ü•µ",
      realExample: "Kepler-7b"
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: "Earth's Cousin",
      description: "This planet is about the same size as Earth and orbits in the 'Goldilocks Zone' - not too hot, not too cold!",
      difficulty: "Medium",
      icon: "üåç",
      clues: {
        size: "Earth-sized (1-2 Earth radius)",
        temperature: "Just right! (like Spring)",
        orbitTime: "About 1 year",
        distance: "Perfect distance from star"
      },
      answer: "CANDIDATE",
      funFact: "This planet is in the 'Goldilocks Zone' where water could be liquid! Just like the three bears' porridge - not too hot, not too cold, just right! Scientists need more observations to be 100% sure it's really a planet. üêª",
      realExample: "Similar to Kepler-452b"
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      title: "The Tricky Shadow",
      description: "Something is blocking starlight, but our space detective tools say it's NOT a planet! What could it be?",
      difficulty: "Hard",
      icon: "üïµÔ∏è",
      clues: {
        size: "Changes shape (weird!)",
        temperature: "Inconsistent",
        orbitTime: "Irregular pattern",
        distance: "The light comes from the wrong place!"
      },
      answer: "FALSE POSITIVE",
      funFact: "This was actually TWO stars orbiting each other! When one passes in front of the other, it looks like a planet transit, but it's really a stellar eclipse. They were playing hide and seek! The telescope got confused, but our AI figured it out! üí´",
      realExample: "Similar to many Kepler false positives"
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      title: "The Mini Neptune",
      description: "This planet is bigger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. It might have clouds of water vapor!",
      difficulty: "Easy",
      icon: "üíß",
      clues: {
        size: "Medium (2-4 Earth radius)",
        temperature: "Cool (like Antarctica)",
        orbitTime: "12 days around its star",
        distance: "Close, but not too close"
      },
      answer: "CONFIRMED",
      funFact: "Planets like this are called 'Mini-Neptunes' or 'Super-Earths'. They're the most common type of planet we've found so far! Our solar system doesn't have any, which makes them extra interesting! ü™ê",
      realExample: "Kepler-11b"
